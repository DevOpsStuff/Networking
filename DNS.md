# DNS ( Domain Naming System ) 

   Basically, If we have used the internet, it means we have used the DNS. DNS is used to convert human readable names(i.e https://google.com) to Internet Protocol(IP) (such as http://172.217.166.110).
   
   Ip Addresses are used by computers to identify each other on the network. And there are two types of IP addressess
   
   * [IPv4](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPv4) (mostly Used)   
   * [IPv6](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPv6)
